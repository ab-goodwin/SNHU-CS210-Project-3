# SNHU-CS210-Project-3
The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following functional requirements: <br />
 <br />
Menu Option One: <br />
1) Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for. <br />
2) Return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word.<br />
 <br />
Menu Option Two: <br />
1) Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased.<br />
The screen output should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file, CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt. For example, the file might read as follows: <br />
 <br />
Potatoes 4 <br />
Pumpkins 5 <br />
Onions 3 <br />
 <br />
Menu Option Three: <br />
 <br />
1) Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram. <br />
2) Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount. <br />
The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt file. <br />
For example, if the file includes 4 potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions, then your text-based histogram may appear as represented below. However, you can alter the appearance or color of the histogram in any way you choose: <br />
 <br />
Potatoes **** <br />
Pumpkins ***** <br />
Onions *** <br />
 <br />
Menu Option Four: <br />
 <br />
1) Exit the program.
